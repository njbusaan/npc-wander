# NPC Wander Area Plugin

---

This plugin is intended to be an easy and convenient way to determine NPC wander distance through the Runelite client.
The idea for this plugin was sparked by the current Tileman Mode trend (a plugin that can be found [here](https://github.com/ConorLeckey/Tileman-Mode)).
Since every tile unlocked is extremely important, knowing the wander distance of NPC's is an invaluable resource.
This plugin is specifically designed for NPC's such as shopkeepers, tutors, etc. and currently is **NOT** meant for mobs.
The whole intent is to provide an easy way for Tileman mode accounts to see where they should place their tiles.

### Planned features:

- [ ] NPC wander distance shown statically as tiles on the ground.
- [ ] Toggles for different groupings of NPC's (shopkeepers, tutors, etc.).
- [ ] Whitelist and blacklist capabilities.
- [ ] Key combinations to easliy turn on and off overlay of tiles.
- [ ] Heatmap to determine tiles more likely to be traversed.
- [ ] Alt-Rightclick options to mark NPC's for wander area.
